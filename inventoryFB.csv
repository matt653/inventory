Well.....It's a 1.4 Chevy Cruze and it runs and drives        
It has brand new bolts under the hood on the engine cover, so I'm assuming that someone already did the big job that these typically have and completed the timing and head gaskets. (According the computer, timing degrees are on par with specs).    
    Body has a few dings, but overall it's decent.     
Everything inside works (buttons, heat, windows, etc)        
Suspension seems good. Brakes are fine. Tires are okay.     
    Check engine light shows a couple exhaust codes and auction mentioned a couple others that haven't shown up. Check with me to see if any of this has materialized.
